WindDemo
-----------
This demo is testing the Wii control for simplified 'head-tracking'.
It is inspired by the wind turbines in Øresund :)
The application depends on http://wiimotelib.codeplex.com

- Place your Wii remote below the screen.
- Wear two IR leds on your head.

This is a simplified version of head-tracking
The program calculates horizontal and vertical rotation angles and modifies the transform of the model.
The distance between the IR led points controls the scale of the model.

The HelixView3D can still be used to manipulate the camera using the mouse.
